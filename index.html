          I've been a Personal Trainer for over <em>Seven Years</em>. In this time I've helped numerous clients reach an assortment of different goals.

            <hr></hr>
            My first job in the Fitness industry was as a Front Desk Attendant at 24 Hour Fitness back in 2007. I became a Personal Trainer in 2008 after graduating from the University of Washington with double Bachelor's in Cell, Molecular and Developmental Biology and in Psychology.

                <h3><strong>My Background</strong></h3>
                <hr></hr>
                <h4><strong>Early Life</strong></h4>
                <p>
                <br>
                I’ve been involved in athletics in some capacity all of my life. Growing up in Germany, I took on the national pastime, soccer, at the age of four. Since then I’ve been involved in some form of sport, including Football, Golf, Track and Field, Swimming, and Baseball. As such I was introduced to strength training at a younger age than most. 
                <br><br>
                My first exposure to an organized strength and conditioning program was in 8th grade. Throughout Junior High and Early High School I continued to train, but without a real understanding of what I was doing. It wasn’t until after an injury and the subsequent surgery at the end of my sophomore year of that I really started to understand the value of strength training.
                <br><br>  
                During the tail end of my freshman year I was playing club soccer and was tackled awkwardly by another player. It resulted in the tearing of my ACL and damaging of my meniscus. Unfortunately the original diagnosis was incorrect and I continued to play on the damaged knee for another 6 months, constantly dislocating it each time I did a hard cut. I finally got surgery to repair the knee towards the middle of my sophomore year. 
                <br><br>
                As I mentioned previously, I didn’t really fall in love with fitness until my sophomore year. While I was rehabbing my knee and I spent a lot of time weight training at the high school and Naval Base Gym as well as working with our High School Sports Medicine team. In this time learned a lot about the human body, nutrition and supplementation. After seeing the changes in my physical condition and the improvements in my strength I knew that fitness would always play a big part in my life. 
                <br><br>
                </p>
                <h4><strong>Personal Training</strong></h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                My first job in the Fitness industry was as a Front Desk Attendant at 24 Hour Fitness back in 2007. In 2008 I became a Personal Trainer after graduating from the University of Washington with double Bachelor's in Cell, Molecular and Developmental Biology and in Psychology. My intentions were to be a Personal Trainer until I decided whether my heart was into attending Medical School. In the meantime I also pursued a Master's in Business Administration and did Volunteer work at the University of Washington and Swedish Orthopedic Center. While studying business I took an interest in Information Management Systems and decided my heart was not in the Medical Field. Because of my background and my experience with research however, I've always been one to look at the science of each trend to see if it can be applicable to my clients success, and I believe the skill of being able to read through research and apply it is what has made me so sucessful as a Personal Trainer. 
                <br><br>
                I have been certified by several national agencies including NCSF, NSCA, NASM, AFAA and NESTA. I worked as a Personal Trainer, then a Master Trainer at 24 Hour Fitness for over 4 years, servicing over 6000 sessions with clients coming from a variety of different backgrounds each having a different specific goal. I left 24 in 2012 to train as a private contractor, first training at Excellence Health and Fitness in South Lake Union and now at Energy Fitness and Wellness on Westlake Avenue.
                <br><br>
                Having the experience of training such diverse populations gave me a better understanding of how to approach each situation. Because of this, I can approach each client with confidence, knowing whatever their goal or limitations I've either worked with someone with a similar background or I have the skill to research and apply what I have learned to their specific needs.

                <h3><strong>Training & Nutrition</strong></h3>
                <p>Trends come and go like the wind in the Fitness industry and as a Trainer it is my responsibility to research these new techniques to see if they can help clients reach their goals quicker. Most of the time the "Fresh New Thing" is just another more complicated version of old methods. In my seven years the thing I've found is most constant is that all things can be achieved through strength. Whether your goal is to get long and lean or big and brawny; an easy-to-follow properly periodized strength and conditioning program will not only help you reach your goal, but also help you sustain it.</p><br>
                <h4><strong>Strength Training</strong></h4>

                  <div class="col-md-6">
                  <p>The primary focus of my programming is helping clients develop a mastery of basic barbell training. Understanding and being able to properly execute the basic barbell movements will not only help you increase your strength much faster than all other methods, but it will also increase your mobility and flexibility to give you long-term pain-free results.
                  <br><br>
                  For beginners free-weight training can be intimidating for many reasons, the most prevalent of which being a lack of understanding of how to properly perform the lifts. With a logical progression I can help take you from a person who is intimidated by others in the gym to someone others can look up to. 
                  <br><br>
                  My programming is built around variations of the Deadlift, Squat, and Bench Press along with the appropriate accessory exercises. For advanced clients the more complex Barbell lifts including the Clean & Jerk and Snatch may be included as well based on his or her goals. As you can see by the chart included these lifts have the highest percentage of motor units recruited, meaning they will be the best and most efficient in increasing overall strength.
                  <br><br>
                  By focusing on these lifts and adjusting training volume and intensity appropriately; I can help you reach any goal, as well as create programs that are simple, easy to follow, and will produce real results.

                <h4><strong>Cardio</strong></h4>
                <hr></hr>
                <p>
                For years the fitness industry preached that the only way to lose fat was to do hours of cardio each week and that strength training would only make you bulky. We were bombarded with images of people in leotards running aerobics classes or infomercials with fit people spending hours on a treadmill or an elliptical. For many this is not only time consuming, but also incredibly boring. Luckily recent research has shown that long cardio sessions are not necessary and may be detrimental unless you're training for an endurance event.  
                <br><br> 
                Cardio falls into two different categories; Low-Intensity Steady State Cardio (LISS) and High Intensity Interval Training (HITT). Each type has a specific purpose and the combination of the two can do wonderful things for your health. 
                <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li><p>LISS is defined as 30-90 minutes of low intensity cardio. It is best for those who have a weak cardio base/high resting heart rate or who have orthopedic conditions that make HITT impossible. It can be used in combination with HITT to increase your calorie deficit.</p></li>
                <li><p>HITT is periods of maximal effort followed by periods of rest. It is superior to LISS for body composition improvements, is more fun and takes significantly less time.</p></li>
                <li><p>So why not do HIIT all the time? Recovery. If you're lifting heavy and doing HITT cardio too frequently your body will not be able to adequately recover increasing the likelihood of injury or unnecessary stress.
                </p></li>  
                </ul>
                <p>The best strategy for cardio is to a combination of the two customized to fit your needs and abilities. For the untrained perhaps more LISS would be prescribed, while for others HITT a couple times a week may be all they need. My job is to define what would be best for you and your long term goals.</p>
                <br>
                <h4><strong>Nutrition</strong></h4>
                <hr></hr>
                <p>Nutrition is one of the easiest subjects to talk about, and the hardest to execute. Unfortunately, if your goal is a change in body composition it will be impossible to achieve unless you adequately address nutrition, regardless of our training. 
                <br><br>
                It seems as if each week there is some new diet to try or cleanse/tea that you can take that will somehow help you lose weight, and everyone has an opinion. You've got your Cross fit friends telling you to do Paleo, your Yoga friends telling you to do some Juice Cleanse, and some Facebook friend is asking you to join them in taking supplements to do some 30 day challenge. All of this can be very confusing and unfortunately most of it is bull crap.  
                <br><br>
                <strong>So what should you do?</strong>
                <br><br>
                I find the program that works best for my clients is one that is a flexible dieting approach which is not especially restrictive. Having a good relationship with your body and food is important for long term adherence to any program. Dietary changes, more so than any other element, need to be lifestyle changes rather than quick fixes. My goal is to educate you to see past all of the crap and understand what works best for you and your body to reach your goals. Then be able to use that knowledge and apply it throughout your life.

                  I started this journey at 280lbs in January of 2010. While always a big man, I used to be athletic and mobile and was once an accomplished athlete in high school. I slowly lost a lot of that athleticism over the years and it gave way to flabbiness, aches, and joint problems. I tried any quick fix that was offered. Diets, Diets, Diets. Finally, after some thought and a lot of personal issues, I just started walking one day.
                  <br><br>
                  I walked to a further bus stop than usual. Then I walked to a further one. I would walk to friends’ houses. I would walk to Safeway instead of taking the bus. Eventually, I found myself getting off at Galer Street and walking all through Queen Anne using the hills and stairs as much as possible on my way to work in Belltown. Eventually I was taking the 9 mile walk two days a week from my job in Belltown to my house on 102nd and Aurora. Combine that with the addition of whole grain breads, vegetarian diet, and the subtraction of large portions, soda, fatty foods and I started to notice a difference in myself very rapidly. I didn’t weigh myself at all. I just kept sticking with the diet and walking day in and day out. I felt re-energized. When I finally weighed myself in March, I weighed 240 lbs. People at work noticed and my friends all noticed a huge change and I liked it. I didn’t want to get complacent. I didn’t want to plateau and get frustrated and quit.

                  That’s when I decided to walk into 24 Hour Fitness one April day. All I wanted was a membership. I had memberships before. Six or seven of them at various gyms throughout California. Six or seven of them that had me attending vigorously for 3 weeks and then had me paying on a contract without even showing up after the initial drive/motivation wore off. I soon realized that I may have been dropping weight, but I was also dropping muscle and needed to build and tone muscle if I truly wanted to be healthy.  So when I signed up I was offered a training package. I bought it and thought I’d see if it would help. 
                  <br><br>
                  I was assigned to Will George whom I was told was an athlete and would be a good match. I weighed in at 235lbs and 31% Body Fat. It started out with 3 sessions, then 5, then 5 more. To say the least, I was so happy I walked in that day and took the offer.  I now stand at 216lbs (last weigh-in) and have lost approximately 20lbs in body fat in roughly 1 month time (Mid-April to Mid-May).  I have put on lean mass and have noticed a great difference in my confidence, focus, motivation, and energy levels. Will has set me on a path. A path I can follow and trust will get me results long term. I am a work in progress, but thanks to the help of Will I am on my way. Now if I could only consistently log my food! I love Turkish Get-Ups!

                    <p>   I’ve always had a love-hate relationship with my waist-line… I loved for it to be small, but hated to work out. I was somewhat “soft” through childhood and adolescence, but joined the track team in high school in order to beef up my college applications. It was great in that it helped me discover the smaller size I craved – I got to a size 2! – but I still didn’t enjoy it. It was boring, plus my flat feet prevented me from excelling, even hurting me at times. So when I went to college, I was more than happy to get lazy again. Between that, the beer, and the late night food, I started getting bigger. After college, stress and a small budget didn’t slow my expansion any.</p>

                  <p>   At age 28, I was asked to be a bridesmaid in a wedding. I was 165 lb and wearing a size 12 while her other maids were all size 2’s.  Determined not to be the “fat bridesmaid,” I joined 24 Hour Fitness. I did cardio on my own for the first few months and dropped 25 lb before the wedding! One again, I was thrilled. But by December, I felt myself slacking off. I was bored again, I was in pain again, and I had plateaued at a size 8. I didn’t want to undo my progress, but I didn’t know how to make it interesting and sustainable. Plus, I had a new goal – my OWN wedding only 6 months away!</p>

                  <p>   Enter Will, stage left.  He listened to my fitness history and my goals, what had worked in the past and what hadn’t, and what I liked and didn’t like. We identified my problem areas, and set a plan that included strength training and nutrition – and NO CARDIO! I knew we were going to get along. We met twice a week for 6 months. At each session, we did different strengthening exercises – never two alike, so I never got bored. Between sessions, he had me go to free fitness classes that 24 Hour offered, like yoga and body pump. Also, he set me up on a routine of sprint intervals on the treadmill, which I liked so much better than just plain running.</p>

                  <p>   During the six months that Will and I worked out together, I didn’t lose any weight. I started at 140 and ended at 140. However, while I started at 24% body fat, I ended at 19.5%. I was in my first pair of size 4 pants since I was 18. I was also so much stronger! I was doing 110 lb dead lifts and 375 lb inclined leg presses! It was amazing! He encouraged me when I needed it, kicked my butt when I deserved it, and congratulated me when I earned it. The results were fantastic, and I felt so beautiful at my wedding.</p>

                  <p>   The best part? Will set me up on a path that I’ve been able to maintain and make a part of my daily routine. After the wedding a year and a half ago, my husband and I left Seattle, so Will and I had to stop training together. However, I took his lessons with me, and the gym and yoga studio are still a part of my life. I still do a combination of sprint intervals, yoga, weight lifting, and elliptical intervals 4-5 days every week. I love the variety, I love the way that I feel, I love that when it hurts, it hurts so good, and I LOVE the way that I look – still! </p>

                  <p style="text-align: center;margin-top:20px;"> When I started working out at 24 Hour Fitness I decided to get a trainer to help me better understand how to get to increase my strength and get to my goal of gaining 10lbs quicker. The membership person set me up with Will mentioning that he was a perfect fit for a person with my goals, and he couldn't have been more right. Within 4 months, I reached my goal. Within 10, I doubled it! With Will's help and knowledge of programming, nutrition, and supplementation I gained close to 25lbs of lean mass. I was skin and bones when I started, barely squatting 75lbs and benching 65lbs. Now I can squat 265 for 5 reps and my bench has increased over 100lbs! I couldn't be happier with the time I spent with Will, my body has completely transformed. Whether your goal is to lose fat (my body fat % actually dropped from 10% to 8%) or gain strength and size Will is a great trainer with the knowledge and know how to get you to where you want to be quickly and safely.</p>

                  <hr></hr>
                  <p>
                  I had always been an active person growing up playing soccer and running track but when I left for college my priorities changed. Four years later I moved back to Seattle and decided I needed to start reevaluating my physical appearance, and lack of strength. I have a physical job as a gardener and landscaper and need to start building muscle and learning proper lifting techniques so I didn't hurt myself. A year ago I did my first half marathon, never thinking I would be able to run let alone walk 13.2 miles. I ran/walked with my mom and finished it in 3:10, not exactly the best time but it was the farthest I had ever gone. I was signed up for another half marathon in Seattle a month and a half later and needed to actually get some training in.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>I started working with Will a week after joining 24 Hour Fitness and right off the bat he put me on a running schedule to help with the long run I had coming up and building the strength I needed to increase my speed and improve my finishing time. He pushed me and kept me motivated to accomplish my goals of finishing the race at about 2:20. Over the course of the next 8 months I have gained about 7 pounds muscle mass and lost about 6 percent body fat. I also just finished my 4th half marathon and finished with 1:57, I took over an hour off my very first half marathon. I am still working toward my goals but have never felt better about myself and the ability to lift more than anyone I know and can now say I can finish 13.2 miles without stopping and feel amazing afterward.</p>
                  <br>

                    <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p>I definitely recommend anyone who is struggling to get started with an exercise routine and get motivated to get out of your slump, get out there and give Will a chance to motivate you and hold you accountable, and push you to be your best. I look forward to my workouts now and enjoy the challenge of lifting more weight or running farther and faster than I ever had before.</p>

          <p>I offer two different ways to train to help you find what best fits you and your lifestyle. You can chose to do one of the better value <strong>Monthly Training Memberships</strong>. Or you can choose one of the more flexible <strong>Training Packages</strong>. Each type of package can be purchased with either <strong>Private</strong> one-on-one training or <strong>Semi-Private Training</strong>.

          <h3>Which is right for you?</h3>
            <p><strong>Monthly Training Membership or Training Package?</p></strong>
            <p2>
            In my experience the clients who have been most successful are those who can meet with me consistently at a specific time each week. To encourage this the Monthly Training Membership offers the best-value in terms of price per session. With the Monthly Training Membership you train at specific times each week set at the beginning of the month. The rate is paid to reserve the time rather than the specific session.
            <br><br>
            If you cannot train at a consistent time, then the Training Packages offer more flexibility. The Training Packages can be purchased in packs of 5, 10 and 20 sessions (20 sessions can only be purchased if you intend on training more than once per week). The larger the initial purchase, the better value per session. 
            </p2>
            <br><br>
            <p><strong>Private or Semi-Private?</strong></p>
            <p2>
            Private One-on-One training is recommended for those who are just starting out, or for those looking to have my undivided attention. If you feel you need a lot of guidance in terms of form/postural correction this is the best option.
            <br><br>
            Semi-Private offers a better price per session, but I may be working with up to 2 other people at the same time. I will try to group people with similar goals, but based on availability it may not always be possible.
            </p2>
            <br><br>
            <p><strong>What is included with the training?</strong></p>
