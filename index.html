In my seven years the thing I've found is most constant is that all things can be achieved through strength.

                    <p>   I’ve always had a love-hate relationship with my waist-line… I loved for it to be small, but hated to work out. I was somewhat “soft” through childhood and adolescence, but joined the track team in high school in order to beef up my college applications. It was great in that it helped me discover the smaller size I craved – I got to a size 2! – but I still didn’t enjoy it. It was boring, plus my flat feet prevented me from excelling, even hurting me at times. So when I went to college, I was more than happy to get lazy again. Between that, the beer, and the late night food, I started getting bigger. After college, stress and a small budget didn’t slow my expansion any.</p>

                  <p>   At age 28, I was asked to be a bridesmaid in a wedding. I was 165 lb and wearing a size 12 while her other maids were all size 2’s.  Determined not to be the “fat bridesmaid,” I joined 24 Hour Fitness. I did cardio on my own for the first few months and dropped 25 lb before the wedding! One again, I was thrilled. But by December, I felt myself slacking off. I was bored again, I was in pain again, and I had plateaued at a size 8. I didn’t want to undo my progress, but I didn’t know how to make it interesting and sustainable. Plus, I had a new goal – my OWN wedding only 6 months away!</p>

                  <p>   Enter Will, stage left.  He listened to my fitness history and my goals, what had worked in the past and what hadn’t, and what I liked and didn’t like. We identified my problem areas, and set a plan that included strength training and nutrition – and NO CARDIO! I knew we were going to get along. We met twice a week for 6 months. At each session, we did different strengthening exercises – never two alike, so I never got bored. Between sessions, he had me go to free fitness classes that 24 Hour offered, like yoga and body pump. Also, he set me up on a routine of sprint intervals on the treadmill, which I liked so much better than just plain running.</p>

                  <p>   During the six months that Will and I worked out together, I didn’t lose any weight. I started at 140 and ended at 140. However, while I started at 24% body fat, I ended at 19.5%. I was in my first pair of size 4 pants since I was 18. I was also so much stronger! I was doing 110 lb dead lifts and 375 lb inclined leg presses! It was amazing! He encouraged me when I needed it, kicked my butt when I deserved it, and congratulated me when I earned it. The results were fantastic, and I felt so beautiful at my wedding.</p>

                  <p>   The best part? Will set me up on a path that I’ve been able to maintain and make a part of my daily routine. After the wedding a year and a half ago, my husband and I left Seattle, so Will and I had to stop training together. However, I took his lessons with me, and the gym and yoga studio are still a part of my life. I still do a combination of sprint intervals, yoga, weight lifting, and elliptical intervals 4-5 days every week. I love the variety, I love the way that I feel, I love that when it hurts, it hurts so good, and I LOVE the way that I look – still! </p>

                  <p>
                  I had always been an active person growing up playing soccer and running track but when I left for college my priorities changed. Four years later I moved back to Seattle and decided I needed to start reevaluating my physical appearance, and lack of strength. I have a physical job as a gardener and landscaper and need to start building muscle and learning proper lifting techniques so I didn't hurt myself. A year ago I did my first half marathon, never thinking I would be able to run let alone walk 13.2 miles. I ran/walked with my mom and finished it in 3:10, not exactly the best time but it was the farthest I had ever gone. I was signed up for another half marathon in Seattle a month and a half later and needed to actually get some training in.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>I started working with Will a week after joining 24 Hour Fitness and right off the bat he put me on a running schedule to help with the long run I had coming up and building the strength I needed to increase my speed and improve my finishing time. He pushed me and kept me motivated to accomplish my goals of finishing the race at about 2:20. Over the course of the next 8 months I have gained about 7 pounds muscle mass and lost about 6 percent body fat. I also just finished my 4th half marathon and finished with 1:57, I took over an hour off my very first half marathon. I am still working toward my goals but have never felt better about myself and the ability to lift more than anyone I know and can now say I can finish 13.2 miles without stopping and feel amazing afterward.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>I definitely recommend anyone who is struggling to get started with an exercise routine and get motivated to get out of your slump, get out there and give Will a chance to motivate you and hold you accountable, and push you to be your best. I look forward to my workouts now and enjoy the challenge of lifting more weight or running farther and faster than I ever had before.</p>
