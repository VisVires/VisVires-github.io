When I first became a member at 24 Hour Fitness I decided to get a trainer to help me get a little bit of knowledge on how to get to my goals of increasing my strength and gaining 10 lbs quicker. The membership person set me up with Will mentioning that he was a perfect fit for a person with my goals and he couldn't have been more right.Within 4 months, I reached my goal. Within 10, I doubled it! With Will's help and knowledge of programming (really? this make you sound like you write software), nutrition and supplementation I gained close to 25lbs of lean mass. I started as the definition of "pencil necked geek" (really? Really??? how about 'I was skin and bones when I started, barely...') barely squating 75lbs and benching 65lbs. Now my squat is up to 265 for 5 reps and my bench has increased over 100lbs! I couldn't be happier with the time I spent with Will, my body has completely transformed. Whether your goal is to lose fat (my body fat % actaully dropped from 10% to 8%) or gain strength and/or size Will is a great laid back trainer with the knowledge and know how to get you to where you want to be quickly and safely.
